    "# Inspect export parameters from .edf files of an EEG database \n",
    "This notebook allows you to inspect the parameters of your .edf EEG database. \\\n",
    "It does not load and inspect the quality of your data. \\\n",
    "It helps you identify if you need to re-export some participant's data (due to poor signal resolution or clipping, as explained later). \\\n",
    "It provides information that helps analyze your dataset (such as the different channel labels, sampling frequency, and filters). \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "EDF (European Data Format) is a standard format for storing multichannel biological and physical signals: https://www.edfplus.info/. \\\n",
    "It was first published in 1992, and an upgraded version was released in 2003 (adding discontinuous recordings handling, annotations, stimuli, and events in a UTF-8 format). \\\n",
    "It is a compressed 16-bit format, meaning that each measured data point can take 2¹⁶ values between the minimum and maximum values that you set at exportation. \\\n",
    "The min/max values correspond to the dynamic range of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "At the exportation in the .edf format (with software like Profusion from Compumedics), many parameters need to be set per recorded channels, such as channels' label, sampling frequency, filtering, units, and dynamic range. \\\n",
    "Exporting as .edf format is tedious and time-consuming, so mistakes in parameters can easily be made.  \\\n",
    "To avoid making mistakes, there is the possibility of implementing montage within some software that will apply your  pre-defined parameters directly **(insert a link on how to make a routine in Compumedics).** \\\n",
    "Inspecting those parameters can also be necessary if you work on an already existing dataset, to make sure that every participant's data is exploitable, specifically if the data comes from multiple sleep clinics. \n",

    "This notebook reads information from the .edf files, instead of loading the data and relying on existing packages. \\\n",
    "Existing packages, such as PYEDFLIB or MNE, are either too rigid (not able to read some data) or do not return all the information (such as boundaries of dynamic range, filtering parameters, etc).\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "**This notebook is intended to stand alone, you just have to run it with the package voila.\\\n",
    "In your terminal, run `voila inspect_edf_voila` to start the notebook.\\\n",
    "Then, you will just have to select your database folder and read the outputs.**\\\n",
    "_The notebook will save summary tables as .tsv files (file format easy to read with Excel and to import in Python script) so that you can visually inspect (or reload later) if needed._\\\n",
    "_Those summaries will be stored in a summary folder within the study folder._\\\n",

    "This notebook is organized into 4 sections:\n",
    "1. Select your study folder, extract the data's information, and return general information\n",
